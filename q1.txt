a number is prime or not :
first you should check if you can divide it to any numbers that is less than that number.
If the reminder become 0 , it is a prime num else it is not prime . 
If the number is 1 , it is not prime 
If the number is 2 then it is prime.
And I made a function in python for it . 
for example 13 can not be divided to any numbers so it is a prime number .
